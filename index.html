      The Stellar Core network depends on validators to ensure liveness and reliability.
      Operating on the Stellar Core network means putting trust in a set of validators,
      also known as a quorum set. Any organization or individual can run a validator,
      thus leveraging their reputation and computing resources to reinforce the network.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the operator of a validator, as the operator of an interface to the Stellar
      Core network (such as Horizon) or simply as an entity doing business on Stellar
      it is important to be aware of which validators are trusted with ensuring the
      health of the network.

      As an introduction to organizations on the Stellar Core network, below is a list
      and chart of the most trusted organizations on the network. Select one to
      get more information about that organization.

    <h3>Quorum picker</h3>
    <p>This section should enable the visitor to pick a good set of validators.</p>
    <p>
      It should also help the visitor with selecting some preferred peers to strengthen
      its chances of having a good network.
    </p>

    <h3>Network overview</h3>
    <p>
      This should answer a set of general questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which validators are there?</li>
      <li>What is their reliability?</li>
      <li>How trusted are they?</li>
      <li>How available are they?</li>
      <li>How connected are they?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Node/Validator/Organization view</h3>
    <p>
      This should answer some questions about a specific entity.
    </p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>Trust Index</h3>
    <p>
      Quorum Explorer currently employs a crude estimate of the amount of trust
      the network in general puts into a specific validator or organization. This
      "trust index" number is just the amount of nodes that have this particular
      validator in their quorumset, divided by the total amount of validators in
      quorumsets. This number is not reliable for any decision, as it can easily
      be gamed, it's just used to roughly order nodes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is important when configuring a quorum set and a set of preferred peers?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You want a quorum set that consists of as many validators that you trust as possible, and also
      as diverse as possible, with a treshold so that a conspiracy would have to span as much
      validators as possible, while still allowing for a maximum number of unreachable/unresponsive
      validators.
    </p>

    <p>
      This actually means that you want your quorumset to be the minimum amount of validators that
      you would still trust to not have a conspiracy greater than the treshold.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next question is which peers do we prefer. We want a group of peers that are reliably
      available, and also that broadcast quorums that contain the validators we are interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      We receive externalize messages from our peers whenever they advance their ledgers. Associated
      with the externalize messages are quorumset hashes. We use this quorumset hash to ask a peer
      which members that quorumset has, and who the owner is of that quorumset.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we receive a statement from a peer saying that it externalizes a message
       by virtue a certain quorumset, how do we know it is correct? Is this pledges?
       are they signed? The quorumset is signed by the message sender. This means we know that
       whoever sent the quorumset believes that particular quorumslice voted for the value it
       accepted.
