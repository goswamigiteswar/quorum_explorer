<h1>Quorum Explorer</h1>

<h3>
  What is important when configuring a quorum set and a set of preferred peers?
</h3>
<p>
  You want a quorum set that consists of as many validators that you trust as possible, and also
  as diverse as possible, with a treshold so that a conspiracy would have to span as much
  validators as possible, while still allowing for a maximum number of unreachable/unresponsive
  validators.
</p>

<p>
  This actually means that you want your quorumset to be the minimum amount of validators that
  you would still trust to not have a conspiracy greater than the treshold.
</p>

<p>
  The next question is which peers do we prefer. We want a group of peers that are reliably
  available, and also that broadcast quorums that contain the validators we are interested in.
</p>

<p>
  We receive externalize messages from our peers whenever they advance their ledgers. Associated
  with the externalize messages are quorumset hashes. We use this quorumset hash to ask a peer
  which members that quorumset has, and who the owner is of that quorumset.
</p>

<p>
  If we receive a statement from a peer saying that it externalizes a message
   by virtue a certain quorumset, how do we know it is correct? Is this pledges?
   are they signed?
