    <h3>Quorum picker</h3>
    <p>This section should enable the visitor to pick a good set of validators.</p>
    <p>
      It should also help the visitor with selecting some preferred peers to strengthen
      its chances of having a good network.
    </p>

    <h3>Network overview</h3>
    <p>
      This should answer a set of general questions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Which validators are there?</li>
      <li>What is their reliability?</li>
      <li>How trusted are they?</li>
      <li>How available are they?</li>
      <li>How connected are they?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Node/Validator/Organization view</h3>
    <p>
      This should answer some questions about a specific entity.
    </p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>
      What is important when configuring a quorum set and a set of preferred peers?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You want a quorum set that consists of as many validators that you trust as possible, and also
      as diverse as possible, with a treshold so that a conspiracy would have to span as much
      validators as possible, while still allowing for a maximum number of unreachable/unresponsive
      validators.
    </p>

    <p>
      This actually means that you want your quorumset to be the minimum amount of validators that
      you would still trust to not have a conspiracy greater than the treshold.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next question is which peers do we prefer. We want a group of peers that are reliably
      available, and also that broadcast quorums that contain the validators we are interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      We receive externalize messages from our peers whenever they advance their ledgers. Associated
      with the externalize messages are quorumset hashes. We use this quorumset hash to ask a peer
      which members that quorumset has, and who the owner is of that quorumset.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we receive a statement from a peer saying that it externalizes a message
       by virtue a certain quorumset, how do we know it is correct? Is this pledges?
       are they signed? The quorumset is signed by the message sender. This means we know that
       whoever sent the quorumset believes that particular quorumslice voted for the value it
       accepted.
